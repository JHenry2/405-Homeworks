        <img src="\Images\ChickenParm.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This is a recipe I found off the internet. I don't particuarly like chicken parm, I just htink it has a weird combination of ingredients.</p>

        <h>Directions</h>
        <ol>
            <li>Hit the chicken breasts with meat mallet until they are 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs then set them aside.</li>
            <li>Mix Bread Crumbs and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, then set that aside too.</li>
            <li>Cover the chicken breats in flour, that means both sides.</li>
            <li>Dip the flour chicken into the eggs then roll it around in the bread crumbs until fully covered.</li
            <li>Fry that chicken, but not too much because it also has to go in the oven</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 450 degrees American</li>
            <li></li>









    </ol>
